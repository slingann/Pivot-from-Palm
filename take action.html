Are the food and products you consume made with sustainably sourced palm oil?<br><br>Pivot from palm and invest in sustainable palm oil that is produced ethically while taking the local environment into consideration. Introducing the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil or RSPO for short, which sets standards while promoting transparency and helping to reform the Palm oil industry, according to online source, OneGreenPlanet.org. The RSPO provides certifications to palm oil plantation farmers and their certification process helps them grow higher yield sustainably. The only way for RSPO to take form is for large corporations to hop on board and join the cause. It’s important to keep these large corporations such as Nestle, Mars, and Unilever accountable for their commitment and actions when it comes to palm oil. As a reader, you can join and help this cause by sharing facts about palm oil, orangutans going extinct, and to make informed decisions as a customer while learning more about this vital topic. We’d recommend looking for palm oil alternatives as well. Additionally, support organizations that give back to the RSPO or write to companies demonstrating that you care about Palm oil. Palm oil today has improved and countries have started to take bold action to protect its rainforests and biodiversity but the fight isn’t over just yet. Remember, make every orangutan count by pivoting from the palm.
