# Pivot from Palm (Sego Lily Hacks)
### 👩🏽‍💻 About the Project
Samiksha, Soumya, and Marleny made Pivot from Palm and submitted it to [Sego Lily Hacks](https://segolilyhacks.com/)! We had so much fun coding this project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Pivot from Palm is a website that encourages site visitors to think about the impacts the palm oil industry has on the environment and endangered animals, such as orangutans. Our website has multiple features for our visitors to interact and gain valuable information about Palm oil. Beginning with our interactive quiz, users can take it to test their knowledge and, based on their results, can choose to visit our site’s different pages. These pages are filled with interesting resources, such as helpful Youtube videos, an engaging Padlet, and tips regarding the next steps and the use of sustainable palm oil.
