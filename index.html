      <p id = "siteWelcome"> Welcome to our website! Palm oil is an environment topic that not many individuals know about. Through "Pivot from Palm", we hope you can learn and help raise awareness about Palm oil's effect on both the environment and animals in their natural habitat sucj as the orangutans. "Palm oil is high in saturated fat" and "up to 300 football fields are cleared every HOUR to make room for palm plantations", according to One Green Planet. </p>

      <p id = "background"> While there may be several positives, the cons outweigh them. Palm oil damages our environment by causing air pollution, water pollution, loss of critical habitat, and contributes to climate change. Several thousand acres of rainforest are burned down to pave the way to build more palm oil plantations. However, as we continue to produce palm oil, itâ€™s vital for us to direct the attention away from us and to the animals that are inhabitants to the forests. 

      Bornean orangutans are a critically endangered species and thereâ€™s estimated to be around 104,700 left, according to Orangutan trekking tours. In fact, there used to be double the amount a decade ago which goes to show how poaching and habitat loss from deforestation and palm plantations can impact a species for the long term. They are gentle, red, share nearly 97% of their DNA with us, and are mostly found in Asia. Itâ€™s essential for us, as human beings, to raise awareness about palm oil production and to save endangered species like the Bornean orangutans from going extinct. The next time you meet someone, ask them if they know about palm oil and tell them to spread awareness and pivot from palm to sustainable palm oil.</p>
