        Have you ever heard of Palm oil? We’re sure that most of you haven’t. Like our team, only 1 out 3 of us knew about this topic and the issue at hand. According to the WWF, Palm oil is “an edible vegetable oil that comes from the fruit of oil palm trees”. We consume and use palm oil in everyday items such as toothpaste, shampoo, lipstick to food like chocolate, pizza, and doughnuts. It’s fascinating how it’s nearly in everything and yet as the general public, we don’t necessarily know about this. One reason why palm oil is readily used is due to the fact how it helps increase the shelf life of products. Additionally, it produces a higher yield and the labor to produce it is quite cheap. It also doesn’t alter the smell or taste of food so that’s another plus point as to why it’s used. The production of palm oil has served as an economic impact especially for the people of Indonesia. Lives of families and individuals have drastically improved where before they were at an economic disadvantage. However, through palm oil, now they have enough money to send their children to school and won’t go hungry. Needless to say, people rely on this to set out of poverty because of how popular it is. But, we can’t focus on just the economic aspect, we need to discuss ecological as well. Palm oil production causes more carbon dioxide to be released into the air and it’s among the top 3 drivers of deforestation in Indonesia. It is a threat to the ecosystem and has resulted in the population decline of Orangutans.
